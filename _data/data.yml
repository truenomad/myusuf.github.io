education:
    - degree: MRes in Musculoskeletal Epidemiology
      university: Manchester Metropolitan University
      time: 2018 - 2019
      supervisors: Prof. Paola Dey, Prof. James Selfe, Prof. Michael Callaghan
      title: |
        The development, validation and testing of the electronic version of the Survey instrument for Natural history,
        Aetiology and Prevalence of Patellofemoral pain Studies (eSNAPPS) tool.
      details: |
        To address the shortfalls of the paper-based SNAPPS (a screening tool to detect those
        with patelLofemoral pain in the general population) by designing, validating and testing
        a robust electronic version of the questionnaire. Deliverables are;

          - A systematic review and meta-analysis looking at survey response rate.
          - An electronic version of SNAPPS tool.
          - An R script to clean data and 'automate' scoring of survey,
          - A study validating eSNAAPS against paper-SNAPPS.
          - A cross-sectional study using the eSNAPPS,
