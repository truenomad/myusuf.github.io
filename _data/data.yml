        The development, validation and testing of the electronic version of the Survey instrument for Natural history,

      details: |
        To address the shortfalls of the paper-based SNAPPS by designing, validating and testing a robust electronic
        version of the questionnaire. These aims will be achieved by;

          - converting the paper version of SNAPPS tool into an electronic version (eSNAPPS),
          - creating an algorithmic script using R to clean the data and 'automate' scoring of survey,
          - validating eSNAAPS against paper-SNAPPS, and
          - testing the robustness of eSNAPPS by piloting 'mass' data collection activity (cross-sectional).
